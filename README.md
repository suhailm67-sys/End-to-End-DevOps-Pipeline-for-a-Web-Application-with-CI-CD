# End-to-End-DevOps-Pipeline-for-a-Web-Application-with-CI-CD
End-to-End DevOps Pipeline for a Web Application with CI/CD

## Problem Statement
DevOps teams require a CI/CD pipeline to streamline the development and deployment process, ensuring that changes are consistently tested, built, and deployed across environments. Using Jenkins as the CI/CD orchestrator, this project will implement an automated pipeline for a Dockerized application that deploys to Kubernetes on AWS EKS. Jenkins will also automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and deployment, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.

## Project Goals
1. Design an application architecture that includes load balancing, container orchestration, and monitoring on AWS.
2. Provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform, including VPC, subnets, and EKS clusters.
3. Automate configuration management with Ansible to streamline server setup and application configuration.
4. Deploy the application on Kubernetes within AWS EKS, ensuring scalability and resilience.
5. Implement Jenkins CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment from code changes to production.
6. Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to monitor infrastructure and application performance.

## Additional Tools for CI/CD Integration
- Jenkins: For orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, building, and deployment.
- Docker: For building container images as part of the CI pipeline.
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl): For managing and deploying resources to EKS within the Jenkins pipeline.
- Jenkins Plugins: Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS CLI plugins for seamless integration with cloud infrastructure.

## DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Architecture Flow
### Overview
This architecture demonstrates an automated CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Dockerized application on Amazon EKS using Jenkins. The pipeline automates the software delivery process from code commit to production deployment while ensuring scalability, reliability, and continuous monitoring.

### Architecture Flow
#### 1. Developer Commits Code
The process begins when a developer pushes the latest application code to the GitHub repository. A GitHub webhook immediately notifies Jenkins about the new commit, triggering the CI/CD pipeline automatically.

#### 2. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
Jenkins acts as the central automation server and orchestrates the entire CI/CD workflow. Once triggered, Jenkins performs the following tasks:
•	Checks out the latest source code from GitHub.
•	Installs project dependencies.
•	Executes automated unit tests to validate the application.
•	Builds the application.
•	Creates a Docker image of the application.
•	Tags the Docker image with the appropriate version.
This automated process ensures that only tested and validated code progresses through the deployment pipeline.

#### 3. Docker Image Repository
After successfully building the Docker image, Jenkins pushes the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). Amazon ECR serves as a secure and centralized container image repository from which Kubernetes can pull the latest application images.

#### 4. Deployment to Amazon EKS
Jenkins uses Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) to deploy the latest application version to the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster.
The deployment includes:
•	Updating Kubernetes Deployment resources.
•	Creating or updating Kubernetes Services.
•	Configuring Ingress resources for external access.
Amazon EKS manages the application containers, automatically maintaining the desired number of running pods and ensuring high availability.

#### 5. Application Load Balancing
The Kubernetes Ingress Controller provisions an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB). All incoming client requests are routed through the load balancer, which distributes traffic across multiple application pods.
This provides:
•	High availability
•	Improved scalability
•	Fault tolerance
•	Efficient traffic distribution

#### 6. End User Access
Users access the application through the AWS Application Load Balancer. Requests are securely routed to the Kubernetes Service, which forwards them to one of the healthy application pods running within the EKS cluster.

#### 7. Monitoring and Visualization
To ensure operational visibility, Prometheus continuously collects metrics from the Kubernetes cluster, application pods, and services.
Grafana connects to Prometheus and presents these metrics through interactive dashboards, allowing administrators to monitor:
•	CPU utilization
•	Memory usage
•	Pod health
•	Application availability
•	Cluster performance
•	Request and response metrics
This monitoring solution enables proactive issue detection and performance optimization.

### Key Benefits
•	Fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
•	Faster and more reliable software releases.
•	Containerized applications ensure consistency across environments.
•	Kubernetes provides automatic scaling, self-healing, and high availability.
•	AWS Application Load Balancer efficiently distributes incoming traffic.
•	Amazon ECR provides secure storage for Docker images.
•	Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time monitoring and performance insights.
•	Reduced manual intervention, resulting in improved deployment efficiency and operational reliability.

### Conclusion
This architecture establishes a modern DevOps workflow by integrating GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, Amazon ECR, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana. The automated pipeline enables rapid, reliable, and scalable application deployments while ensuring continuous monitoring and simplified application management in the AWS cloud.
